      A DEAD female body lies at the bottom of a multistory building. It looks
      as though she committed suicide by jumping from one of the floors.</p>
    <p>
      When the detective arrives, he goes to the first floor of the building,
      opens the closed window, and flips a coin towards the floor.
    </p><p>
      He goes to the second floor and does the same exact thing. He continues to
      do this until he gets to the top floor of the building.
    </p><p>
      When he comes back down, he states that it was a MURDER and not a suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
      How does he know that?
